<h2 class="menu" id="statement">statement of research</h2>

<p>
The activities of each organism on earth have a critical impact on the delicate balance of the
 ecosystem.The interactions among the living entities on our planet have always fascinated me since I my education in Botany for Bachelor’s degree. During my post-graduation course in Plant
  Biology and Biotechnology, I aimed for my research to be a comprehensive integration of both
   fundamental knowledge and its applications. My interest in microbial diversity was first
    kindled during the dissertation project for the Master’s program, when I investigated the diversity of anammox Planctomycetes across the eastern regions of India. Planctomycetes are an
     enigmatic group of bacteria with high potential in biotechnological applications as their
      activities are critical in the global carbon and nitrogen cycle. The anammox
       Planctomycetes have the capability to convert ammonia and nitrite to dinitrogen.During
        my first year of PhD, I got the opportunity to deal with the “difficult to cultivate”
         members of Planctomycetes including anammox bacteria. Prior academic work had helped
          me develop various technical skills in microbial culturing and characterization,
           imaging, and computational skills. I also nurtured soft skills like scientific
            thinking and communication. Previous research experiences had given me excellent
             leads in the topic of association of algae and sponge with planctomycetes and
              anammox bacteria . This resulted in my contribution as a co-author in two peer
              -reviewed publications and a few more which are in the pipeline. The exploration
               of anammox diversity is very important especially considering increasing
                concerns for the development of energy-efficient and carbon-dependent nitrogen 
                removal technology for mainstream wastewater treatment. Due to these reasons, I 
                find myself motivated to work in this area using both culture- dependent and independent strategies in order to study these bacteria more intimately. Algae being known as 
   one of the best habitats for Planctomycetes, I would like to focus on algal associated
    anammox diversity. The importance of this work can be explained from the very fact that not
     even a single anammox bacterium has been isolated in pure culture anywhere in the world.
      Also, not many labs are working on Planctomycetes and not many anammox bioreactors are
       operating in India to treat wastewater.This is a highly underexplored research area in
        India from a biogeographic and biotechnological point of view. When given the chance I
         hope this work can represent India at the frontiers of anammox research globally.
          Recognition through the prestigious PMRF scheme will greatly benefit in bringing this
           field out of its infancy as well as in encouraging others to bring more research
            focus to it. In summary, I truly believe that, this fellowship can boost my
             confidence to venture new challenges in anammox research which would in the long
              term, result in high impact factor publications, and subsequently formulating
               effective microbial consortia for sustainable and energy-efficient wastewater treatment.
